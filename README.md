# CMPE-297 Special Topics Project

This is the application part of my project. I exported my trained model from Colab and built a simple web API using Python Flask and Apache to make the API accessible on port 80. The main code for the application is in the "html" directory which is mainly built using jQuery and Bootstrap.
